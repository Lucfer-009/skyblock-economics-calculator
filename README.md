# Skyblock-Economics-Calculator

This code is designed to acomplish medicore mathematical tasks quickly and display as much convient infomation to
you as possible. The goal with this calculator was to make it as easy to use in a CLI format as possible. With the
ability to save minion setups and default materials this is set up for speed and acessibility to the best of my
ability.

Most similar applications often didn't provide as depthed infomation and relied a lot on the user remembering and
taking notes, this takes a siginicant amount of the hassle away from the user and gives nice clean and useful
statistics.

The fact that it's CLI provides a lot of benefits when in regards to its developement. I can easily push out improvements,
updates and new features without having to spend arguably more time on the GUI than on the actual logic at play. Not to
mention I'm not all that comfortable in Windows apps, so maybe in the future I'll work on something with a GUI.
